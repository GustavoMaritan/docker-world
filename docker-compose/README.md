# docker-compose-files

In this folder you will find some docker compose yml files and some environments that you can build and run with it.

NOTE: This environments contains some nodejs, java, go or .Net apps. Please, don't use this apps as a model to your own. As I saw, the objective is show how to use docker compose and nothing more.
